North Carolina State University - ECE 563 - Microprocessor Architecture

High Level Overview

o Programmed a bimodal, gshare, and hybrid branch predictor to simulate the effects of different branch prediction models on multiple traces.
o The program would track mispredictions, comparing the predictions made by the branch history table against the actual taken path.
o A report was compiled comparing different models, size constraints, and misprediction penalties. 

File Descriptions

Sim_bp.h - header file that includes the BHT variables and various model function definitions.

Bht.cc - cpp file that contains the bimodal, gshare, and hybrid model function implementations. This file also contains various stats for recording.
